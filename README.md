# About C. Clavus

> “Claudius Clavus \[…\] (born 14 September 1388), was a Danish
> geographer sometimes considered to be the first Nordic cartographer
> \[…\] In 1412–13 at the age of 25 he started to travel around Europe
> and appeared eleven years later (1423–24) in Rome. It is believed he
> travelled as far north as the 70°10’ N. lat. In Rome he became friends
> with the cardinal Giordano Orsini and the pope’s secretary Gian
> Francesco Poggio Bracciolini, who were among those working to update
> the old Roman cartography. Claudius contributed to a more realistic
> description of Nordic countries, in particular Iceland and Greenland,
> and was probably the first cartographer to put Greenland on a map. He
> is also known for having named Greenlandic places by using lyrics from
> old folk songs.”
